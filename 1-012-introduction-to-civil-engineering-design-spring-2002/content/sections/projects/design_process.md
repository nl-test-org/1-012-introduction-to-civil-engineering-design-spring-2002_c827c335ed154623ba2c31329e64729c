General Design Process
----------------------

1.  General Design Process
2.  Understand Problem
3.  Conceptual Design
4.  Embodiment Design
5.  Detail Design
6.  Prototype and Testing
7.  Completion (Implementation)

What is Design
--------------

*   Creative
*   Synthesis
*   No Unique Solution/Open Ended Problem
*   Collaboration in a Team

Learning of Design

*   Problem Formulation is as Important as Problem Solution
*   Do Design
*   Design Process and Tools

The Decision Analysis Cycle
---------------------------

(after Stael von Holstein, 1973)

![The Design Analysis Cycle.](/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-012-introduction-to-civil-engineering-design-spring-2002/projects/decision_analysis.jpg)

| **Deterministic Phase** | **Probabilistic Phase** |
| 1\. Define Problem and Limits of Investigation | 1\. Express Uncertainty in Variables by Means of Probabilities |
| 2\. Alternative Courses of Action | 2\. Probabilistic Model |
| 3\. Outcomes of Each Alternative | 3\. Establish Relative Value of Probabilistic Outcomes |
| 4\. Select Decision and State Variables | 4\. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis |
| 5\. Relate Outcomes and Variables | &nbsp; |
| 6\. Time Preference | **Information Phase** |
| 7\. Dominated Alternatives Eliminated | 1\. Value of Perfect Information |
| 8\. Sensitivity of Outcome to Variables | 2\. Evaluate Various Information Collection Schemes
