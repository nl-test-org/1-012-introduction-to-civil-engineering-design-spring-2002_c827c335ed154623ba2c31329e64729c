Assignment
----------

After having worked out your solution for the development of the Back Bay, the articles listed below will tell you, what in fact has been done to develop the Charles River Basin in general and Back Bay in particular. They will inform you about the problems encountered and the chosen remedies.

Please read the Charles River articles (available in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) section) and then compare your solution to what has been done. Most importantly you should assess, if you would change your solution based on this information or not. You need to also provide your reasons for this. This needs to be done in form a report of about 4 pages (typed, double spaced) which has to be prepared individually (not by the team!)
